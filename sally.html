                Hello, my love.
                <br>
                I hope you have an amazing day today and that every time you watch this video, it can bring a smile to your face and make you feel much better.
                <br>
                I want to express to you how much it means to me that you're with me, how much you mean to me.
                <br>
                Since I met you in that game, I've felt a strong connection with you. From the first moment you spoke to me, I felt that you were an excellent person, and the truth is that I wasn't wrong.
                <br>
                <br>
                All the time I've spent with you has been as valuable as it has been meaningful to me. Everything has been so beautiful and satisfying that I want to feel this for my whole life... I feel that if I hadn't met you that day, my life would still be gray and dull. Everything I did would still be meaningless; everything would be boring and common to me. But here you are, giving me beautiful moments and lessons to nourish me with everything you leave behind, making me laugh and turning gray days into better ones, bringing me happiness and harmony both together and alone, making me know that I can always improve in things and be a better person, a better boyfriend and friend, a better family member and a good companion.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you for appearing in my life, thank you for provoking the best sensations in me that want to surface every time they appear, thank you for not letting me die alone in a world full of ashes everywhere, thank you for easing the pains and accompanying me in moments of bitterness even if you don't know it, thank you for being the best girlfriend I could have, for giving me details that no one had ever given me, for being so strong and resilient after all the problems we've had, for teaching me that love has no limits and that with love everything is possible, thank you for being so you, for teaching me a bit about your past, for making me understand that my little girl needs so much pure and true love, a special love, that surpasses the barriers of the normal and transcends the cruel truths and the pressures of society.</p>
